### 🧩 Problem Statement  
There are **n** children standing in a line, and each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

Your task is to distribute candies to these children under two rules:
1. Each child must receive at least **1 candy**.
2. A child with a **higher rating** than an adjacent child must receive **more candies** than that neighbor.

Return the **minimum number of candies** required to satisfy these conditions.

---

### 📊 Example

#### Input:
```java
ratings = [1, 0, 2]
```

#### Output:
```java
5
```

#### Explanation:
- Child 1 (rating 1): gets 2 candies  
- Child 2 (rating 0): gets 1 candy  
- Child 3 (rating 2): gets 2 candies  
Total = `2 + 1 + 2 = 5`

### 💡 Approach: Greedy Two-Pass Strategy

1. **Initialization**:  
   Assign every child 1 candy (minimum required).

2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:  
   If a child has a higher rating than the one before them, give them one more candy than the previous child.

3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:  
   If a child has a higher rating than the next child AND has equal or fewer candies, update their count to be one more than the next child.

4. **Result**:  
   Sum the values in the candy array.

### 🧪 Dry Run (for `[1, 0, 2]`)

| Index | Rating | Left-to-Right | Right-to-Left | Final Candies |
|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 0     | 1      | —              | 1 > 0 → +1      | 2              |
| 1     | 0      | —              | —              | 1              |
| 2     | 2      | 2 > 0 → +1      | —              | 2              |

✅ Total Candies = `2 + 1 + 2 = 5`

### 🧑‍💻 Code — Java Implementation
```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candy = new int[n];

        Arrays.fill(candy, 1); // Every child gets at least one candy

        // Left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (ratings[i + 1] > ratings[i]) {
                candy[i + 1] = candy[i] + 1;
            }
        }

        // Right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i - 1] > ratings[i] && candy[i - 1] <= candy[i]) {
                candy[i - 1] = candy[i] + 1;
            }
        }

        // Sum total candies
        int total = 0;
        for (int c : candy) total += c;
        return total;
    }
}
```

### 🏁 Complexity

- **Time**: `O(n)` — Two linear passes over the array  
- **Space**: `O(n)` — For the `candy` array
