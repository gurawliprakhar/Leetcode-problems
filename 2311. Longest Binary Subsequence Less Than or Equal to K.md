# 📌 Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K (LeetCode 2311)

A **Java implementation** for solving LeetCode problem **[2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/)**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Summary

Given a binary string `s` (composed only of `'0'`s and `'1'`s) and an integer `k`, **find the length of the longest subsequence** (characters selected in order, but not necessarily contiguously) such that the binary value of that subsequence is **less than or equal to `k`**.

---

## 🚀 Example

### Input:

```
s = "1001010"
k = 5
```

### Possible Valid Subsequences:

| Subsequence | Binary Value | Length | Valid |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| "00010"     | 2            | 5      | ✅     |
| "00101"     | 5            | 5      | ✅     |
| "00100"     | 4            | 5      | ✅     |

### Output:

```
5
```

## ✅ Approach: Greedy with Bit Position Awareness

### Core Ideas:

* **Zeros are always safe** to include (don't affect the binary value much, especially with leading zeros).
* **Ones are expensive** (increase the binary value by powers of 2 depending on position).
* **Process from right-to-left**, because the **rightmost characters contribute least to the binary value (smallest bit positions)**.
* Selectively include `'1'`s **only if adding them doesn’t exceed `k`**.

---

## 🛠️ Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize:

   * `count = 0`: To track length of subsequence.
   * `val = 0`: Current binary value.
   * `bit = 0`: Tracks current bit position (right-to-left).

2. Traverse `s` **from right to left**:

   * For each character:

     * If `'0'`: Always include.
     * If `'1'`: Include \*\*only if adding its binary weight keeps the value ≤ `k`.

3. Stop including `'1'`s once further additions would exceed `k`.

## 💻 Java Solution

```java
public class LongestBinarySubsequence {

    public int longestSubsequence(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        long val = 0;
        int bit = 0;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == '0') {
                count++;  // Always include zeros
            } else {
                if (bit < 31) {  // Prevent overflow for large k
                    long potential = val + (1L << bit);
                    if (potential <= k) {
                        val = potential;
                        count++;
                    }
                    bit++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestBinarySubsequence lbs = new LongestBinarySubsequence();
        String s = "1001010";
        int k = 5;
        int result = lbs.longestSubsequence(s, k);
        System.out.println("Longest subsequence length: " + result);
    }
}
```

| 2        | 0    | Include                     | 2             | 3            | 4           |

| 0        | 1    | Skip                        | 2             | 4            | 5           |

**Final Answer:**
✅ `5`

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity:

| Metric | Complexity |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Time   | O(n)       |
| Space  | O(1)       |

* Single pass over the string.
* Constant space, only primitive variables used.

---

## ✅ Why This Works (Greedy Proof Intuition):

This **greedy right-to-left selection** works because:

* We're always making the best local decision:
  **"Can I afford to add this bit without violating `k`?"**

* For bits with lower weights (right side), the risk of crossing `k` is lower.

* Leading zeros don’t affect the value, so including all zeros ensures maximizing subsequence length.
