# 🔁 Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the **maximum length** of a subarray that appears in both arrays.  
A subarray must be **contiguous** and the **order must match**.

## 🧠 Approach: Sliding Alignment

Instead of classical DP, we simulate a "sliding window alignment"—we slide one array across another and compare overlapping sections.

### Steps:
- Fix one array and slide the other over it.
- At each alignment, calculate how many consecutive elements match.
- Track the longest matching streak across all alignments.

## 💻 Java Code (Sliding Alignment)

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        return Math.max(
            maxMatch(nums1, nums2),
            maxMatch(nums2, nums1)
        );
    }

    public int maxMatch(int[] a, int[] b) {
        int maxLen = 0;
        int n = a.length, m = b.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int len = Math.min(m, n - i);
            int matchLen = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
                if (a[i + j] == b[j]) {
                    matchLen++;
                    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, matchLen);
                } else {
                    matchLen = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Example Dry Run

### Input:
```plaintext
nums1 = [1,2,3,2,1]
nums2 = [3,2,1,4,7]
```

### Sliding Alignment:
```
Alignment:
[1,2,3,2,1]       ← nums1
      [3,2,1,4,7] ← nums2

Matching Segment: [3,2,1]
Length = 3
```

### Output:
```plaintext
3
```

## 🚀 Complexity Analysis

| Type        | Value      |
|-------------|------------|
| Time        | O(n * m)   |
| Space       | O(1)       |
| Optimization| Fast in practice due to early break and limited overlaps |

---

## ✨ Notes

- This method avoids using extra space from traditional DP tables.
- For further optimization, consider rolling hash + binary search (`O((n + m) * log(min(n, m)))`).
