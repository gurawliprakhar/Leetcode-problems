# 📌 Problem: Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time

## 🧠 Problem Statement (Simple Words)

You're given a list of `n` meetings and a total time window from `0` to `eventTime`.

Each meeting has:

* A **start time** and **end time**
* All meetings are sorted and **non-overlapping**

You're allowed to **reschedule at most `k` meetings**.
When rescheduling:

* You can **change the start time**, but **must keep the duration same**
* Meetings should **not overlap**
* Meetings should stay **in the same order**
* All must fit within `eventTime`

🎯 Your goal is to **maximize the longest continuous free time** during the day.

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### Input:

```java
eventTime = 10;
k = 1;
startTime = [0, 2, 9];
endTime   = [1, 4, 10];
```

Meetings:

```
[0,1], [2,4], [9,10]
```

You are allowed to **reschedule 1 meeting**.

👉 Move the second meeting \[2,4] to \[1,3]:

New meetings:

```
[0,1], [1,3], [9,10]
```

Now there is a **free time from 3 to 9**, which is `6`.

✅ Output: `6`

## ❓ Why Sliding Window?

If you **reschedule `k` meetings**, you can compress them to eliminate up to **`k` gaps** between them. This affects **`k + 1` gaps** (the spaces between the meetings you're compressing).

The idea is to find the **largest block of free time** formed by these `k + 1` consecutive gaps.
A **fixed-size sliding window** of size `k + 1` helps us find this.

---

## 🔍 Which Sliding Window?

* We use a **fixed-size sliding window** of size `k + 1`
* It slides over the `gaps[]` array which represents:

  * Gap before first meeting
  * Gaps between meetings
  * Gap after the last meeting

---

## ✅ Java Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int k, int[] startTime, int[] endTime) {
        int n = startTime.length;
        int[] gaps = new int[n + 1];

        // 1. Calculate the free time before first meeting
        gaps[0] = startTime[0];

        // 2. Gaps between meetings
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            gaps[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1];
        }

        // 3. Free time after the last meeting
        gaps[n] = eventTime - endTime[n - 1];

        // 4. Fixed-size sliding window of size k + 1
        int maxFreeTime = 0;
        int curWindowSum = 0;
        int l = 0;

        for (int r = 0; r < gaps.length; r++) {
            curWindowSum += gaps[r];

            if (r - l + 1 > k + 1) {
                curWindowSum -= gaps[l];
                l++;
            }

            if (r - l + 1 == k + 1) {
                maxFreeTime = Math.max(maxFreeTime, curWindowSum);
            }
        }

        return maxFreeTime;
    }
}
```

## 🧮 Detailed Dry Run

### Input:

```java
eventTime = 10
k = 1
startTime = [0, 2, 9]
endTime   = [1, 4, 10]
```

---

### Step 1: Compute `gaps[]`

```java
gaps[0] = startTime[0] = 0
gaps[1] = startTime[1] - endTime[0] = 2 - 1 = 1
gaps[2] = startTime[2] - endTime[1] = 9 - 4 = 5
gaps[3] = eventTime - endTime[2]    = 10 - 10 = 0

=> gaps = [0, 1, 5, 0]
```

---

### Step 2: Sliding Window of size `k + 1 = 2`

Initial:

```java
maxFreeTime = 0
curWindowSum = 0
l = 0
```

---

#### r = 0:

```java
curWindowSum += 0 → 0
window size = 1 → too small → skip
```

---

#### r = 1:

```java
curWindowSum += 1 → curWindowSum = 1
window size = 2 → valid
maxFreeTime = max(0, 1) = 1 ✅
```

---

#### r = 2:

```java
curWindowSum += 5 → 6
window size = 3 → too big → shrink
curWindowSum -= gaps[0] = 6 - 0 = 6
l = 1
window size = 2 → valid
maxFreeTime = max(1, 6) = 6 ✅
```

---

#### r = 3:

```java
curWindowSum += 0 → 6
window size = 3 → shrink
curWindowSum -= gaps[1] = 6 - 1 = 5
l = 2
window size = 2 → valid
maxFreeTime = max(6, 5) = 6 ✅
```

---

### 🔚 Final Output:

```java
return maxFreeTime = 6
```

## ⏱️ Complexity

| Type  | Complexity |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Time  | `O(n)`     |
| Space | `O(n)`     |

---

## 🙌 Summary

* We turn meeting times into a **gaps array**
* Use a **fixed-size sliding window** of size `k + 1`
* Track the **maximum sum of consecutive gaps**
* This gives the **maximum continuous free time** we can create
