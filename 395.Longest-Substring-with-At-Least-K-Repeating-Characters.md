# 📜 Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

## 🧙‍♂️ Problem Story

Once upon a string...

Imagine you have a long ribbon of lowercase letters. You're searching for the most powerful spell hidden within—a substring where **every character appears at least `k` times**. If any letter in your chosen piece is too weak (appears less than `k` times), the spell breaks.

Your goal: find the **longest valid substring** where each letter shows up at least `k` times. If no such substring exists, return `0`.

Think of it like picking ingredients for a cake—you need at least `k` scoops of every required item. If anything falls short, it’s not a proper cake… or spell!

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the **longest substring** where **every character appears ≥ k times**.

### Example 1:
```text
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest valid substring is "aaa"
```

### Example 2:
```text
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: "ababb" is the longest valid substring
```

---

## 🚀 Approach

We use a **multi-pass sliding window**. For every possible target number of unique characters (1 to 26), we:

1. Slide a window through the string.
2. Track character frequencies.
3. Check whether every character in the window appears ≥ `k` times.

If so, we update our longest valid substring length.

### Time Complexity:
- $$O(26 \cdot n)$$ where `n` is the length of the string

### Space Complexity:
- $$O(1)$$ — constant space for tracking 26 letters

## 🧾 Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        int maxLen = 0;

        for (int targetUnique = 1; targetUnique <= 26; targetUnique++) {
            int[] count = new int[26];
            int start = 0, end = 0, unique = 0, countAtLeastK = 0;

            while (end < s.length()) {
                if (unique <= targetUnique) {
                    int idx = s.charAt(end) - 'a';
                    if (count[idx] == 0) unique++;
                    count[idx]++;
                    if (count[idx] == k) countAtLeastK++;
                    end++;
                } else {
                    int idx = s.charAt(start) - 'a';
                    if (count[idx] == k) countAtLeastK--;
                    count[idx]--;
                    if (count[idx] == 0) unique--;
                    start++;
                }

                if (unique == targetUnique && unique == countAtLeastK) {
                    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Dry Run Example

Let’s dry run with `s = "ababbc"` and `k = 2`. We'll fix `targetUnique = 2`.

### Initial State:
```
start = 0, end = 0
unique = 0, countAtLeastK = 0
count = [0 x 26]
maxLen = 0
```

### Step-by-step:

1. Add 'a' → unique = 1, countAtLeastK = 0
2. Add 'b' → unique = 2
3. Add 'a' again → 'a' reaches k ⇒ countAtLeastK = 1
4. Add 'b' again → 'b' reaches k ⇒ countAtLeastK = 2  
   ✅ Valid window: "abab" → maxLen = 4
5. Add another 'b' → still valid → "ababb" → maxLen = 5
6. Add 'c' → unique becomes 3  
   ❌ Exceeds target, start shrinking...

Eventually, longest valid substring = `"ababb"` → **length = 5**

## ✨ Conclusion

This sliding window method balances frequency counting and uniqueness constraints smartly. It’s efficient, intuitive, and easy to teach—especially with dry runs!

Want me to make an image version of this walkthrough or sketch out a visual tracker for the variables during the dry run? I’d love to help!
