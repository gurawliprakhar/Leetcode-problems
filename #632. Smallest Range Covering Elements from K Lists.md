🎯 **Problem Title:** Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists

🧩 **Setup:**  
You're given **k sorted lists** of integers.

🔍 **Goal:**  
Find the **smallest range [a, b]** that contains **at least one number from each list**.

📐 **What's a "smallest range"?**  
We compare ranges by:
- First, **width** (`b - a`)
- If widths are equal, the one with the **smaller starting number** (`a`) wins

📊 **Example:**  
Input:  
`[[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]`  
✅ One valid answer: `[20, 24]`  
Because:
- 24 from list 1  
- 20 from list 2  
- 22 from list 3  
All fit inside `[20, 24]`

🧠 **Think of it like:**  
Sliding a window across lists, keeping at least one number from each—then finding the tightest fit.

---
 Here’s a clear and thorough breakdown of the LeetCode example for **Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists**:

---

### 📊 Example Input
```java
nums = [[4,10,15,24,26], 
        [0,9,12,20], 
        [5,18,22,30]]
```

You have three sorted lists, and you need to find the **smallest range** `[a, b]` that contains **at least one element from each list**.

---

### 🎯 Valid Output
```java
Output: [20,24]
```

---

### ✅ Why [20,24] is Correct

Let’s look inside the range `[20, 24]` and check:

- **From List 1**:  
  ✅ `24` is inside `[20, 24]`

- **From List 2**:  
  ✅ `20` is inside `[20, 24]`

- **From List 3**:  
  ✅ `22` is inside `[20, 24]`

So:
- Every list has **at least one number in this range**
- The **width of the range** is `24 - 20 = 4`
- There’s **no smaller range** that satisfies the condition

---

### 🔎 Why Not [18, 24] or [22, 30]?

- `[18, 24]` is wider (size = 6) and might not include a number from List 2
- `[22, 30]` misses values from List 2 like `20`

Hence, `[20,24]` is optimal.

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
   public int[] smallestRange(List<List<Integer>> nums) {
    // Min-heap to keep track of the current minimum element across k lists
    PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    // Initialize heap with first element from each list
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int val = nums.get(i).get(0);
        minHeap.offer(new int[] { val, i, 0 }); // value, list index, element index
        max = Math.max(max, val); // track the current maximum across lists
    }

    int rangeStart = 0, rangeEnd = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    // Keep sliding the window until one list runs out of elements
    while (minHeap.size() == nums.size()) {
        int[] curr = minHeap.poll(); // smallest element
        int min = curr[0], i = curr[1], j = curr[2];

        // Update the result range if better
        if (max - min < rangeEnd - rangeStart || 
           (max - min == rangeEnd - rangeStart && min < rangeStart)) {
            rangeStart = min;
            rangeEnd = max;
        }

        // Move to next element from the same list
        if (j + 1 < nums.get(i).size()) {
            int next = nums.get(i).get(j + 1);
            minHeap.offer(new int[] { next, i, j + 1 });
            max = Math.max(max, next);
        }
    }

    return new int[] { rangeStart, rangeEnd };
}

}
```
 **step-by-step dry run** of your `PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);` logic inside the `smallestRange()` solution. I’ll walk you through each loop iteration as if we were debugging it together.

### 🧪 Dry Run Setup

**Input:**
```java
nums = [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
```

**Initialization:**
```java
minHeap → stores [value, listIndex, valueIndex]
max = -∞
```

### 🎬 Step 1: Push first elements from each list

| Action | Heap State | max |
|-------|------------|-----|
| push [4,0,0] | [[4,0,0]] | 4 |
| push [0,1,0] | [[0,1,0], [4,0,0]] | 4 |
| push [5,2,0] | [[0,1,0], [4,0,0], [5,2,0]] | 5 |

> Comparator ensures smallest value at top → `poll()` gives [0,1,0]

---

### 🎬 Step 2: Poll [0,1,0] → push [9,1,1]

- Range = `[0,5]`  
- Update min: 0, max: 5
- Next from List 1 is `9`

| Action | Heap State | max |
|--------|------------|-----|
| poll → [0,1,0] | [[4,0,0], [5,2,0]] | 5 |
| push [9,1,1] | [[4,0,0], [5,2,0], [9,1,1]] | 9 |

---

### 🎬 Step 3: Poll [4,0,0] → push [10,0,1]

- Range = `[4,9]`  
- Next from List 0 is `10`

| Action | Heap State | max |
|--------|------------|-----|
| poll → [4,0,0] | [[5,2,0], [9,1,1]] | 9 |
| push [10,0,1] | [[5,2,0], [9,1,1], [10,0,1]] | 10 |

---

### 🎬 Step 4: Poll [5,2,0] → push [18,2,1]

- Range = `[5,10]`  
- Next from List 2 is `18`

| Action | Heap State | max |
|--------|------------|-----|
| poll → [5,2,0] | [[9,1,1], [10,0,1]] | 10 |
| push [18,2,1] | [[9,1,1], [10,0,1], [18,2,1]] | 18 |

---

### 🎬 Continue until any list is exhausted

This loop continues:
- Always polling the smallest `a[0]`
- Updating range if `max - min` is smaller
- Pushing next value from the same list
- Ending when any list runs out

---

### ✅ Final Range: [20,24]

It’s the tightest window containing at least one number from each list:
- 24 from List 0  
- 20 from List 1  
- 22 from List 2
